Voice control is a major growing feature that change the way people can 
live. The voice assistant is commonly being used in smartphones and laptops. 
AI-based Voice assistants are the operating systems that can recognize human 
voice and respond via integrated voices. This voice assistant will gather the 
audio from the microphone and then convert that into text, later it is sent 
through GTTS (Google text to speech). GTTS engine will convert text into 
audio file in English language, then that audio is played using play sound 
package of python programming Language. It will look at examples of 
intelligent programs with natural language processing that are currently 
available, with different categories of support, and examine the potential 
usefulness of one specific piece of software as a VPA. This engages the ability 
to communicate socially through natural language processing, holding (and 
analysing) information within the context of the user.
